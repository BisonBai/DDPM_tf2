# DDPM_tf2
This our Group project. We implemented DDPM on Tensorflow2, and reproduce some results on a smaller dataset. Moreover, we attempt to use DDPM on speech synthesis.

## Extension: Speech Synthesis
### Requirements:
- Python3
- Tensorflow == 2.6
- Keras == 2.6
- Numpy == 1.23.0
- Librosa == 0.7.2

### Datasets
Using a small dataset that recorded in an anechoic chamber. The dataset contains ten speakers, each with 18 sentences, for a total of 180 sentences. The sentences are all identical, and the sentence contents are taken from press releases. 
The dataset has not been published yet, will be avaliable at: https://github.com/ASP-WHU/Mandarin-Lombard-Grid
